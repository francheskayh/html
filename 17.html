<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iloilo is the place is would always go back to since we go here every after 3 years because of our Family Reunion in my dad's side.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the place I would never grow tired of since I see improvements everytime I go back there. Though the city has become crowded and traffic, I still find it like a rural area because of the people. I would never grow tired of listening to their sweet accent and their caring personally.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Iloilo, Delos Santos Clan occupies a entire barangay, literally, and because of that, the reunion is the wildest thing to anticipate for. Millenials enjoy the party 'til the break of dawn while the oldies have non-stop chikahan since it is a 3-day escape from our own perspective lives.
