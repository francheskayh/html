&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom is my ultimate "frienemy", seriously. Wheneve we talk, my mood towards her shifts fast like a blink of an eye. We could never be only friends in a day. It has to have those to labels to make both of our day complete. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we always tease and annoy each other, we are each other's support, secret keeper and "chikadora". I always tell her everything that happened to me for the day in school or anywhere that she is not around to know. My dad and her knows my crushes and those things that other teenagers doesn't seem t share with their parents, that I share too.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still remember being taller than him for 17 years when sunddenly he grew way taller than I could ever be and I could never catch up. Nonetheless, he will always be my baby brother. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is never fond of photos or anything that has to do with being inside the frame of a camera, but he loves to take pictures and videos. He is a music lover; if I have to know that are the new songs, I always ask him.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hates the fact that I keep on bugging him and because of that, he rather stay inside his room than in the living room with me and my mom.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a beautiful name that sometimes people mistakes it as a girl's name.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Beryl</strong>. Does it sound like it belongs to a girl?
