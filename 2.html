<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the day, my parents told me and my brother that we are moving to Tacloban, Leyte. During that day, I was kind of excited because we are to ride a ship for the first time. I remember me and brother jumping because of excitement.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it all changed.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because moving to a new place means moving on to a new home, environment, neighbors, school, classmate, church, friends and the list goes on and on. I remember going there and finding out that there was no SM or Robinsons around to go for shopping or to buy groceries except for a Gaisano Mall which I haven't heard of before. I remember having only a motorcycle to ride from one place to another since there were few tricycle around because the roads were not concrete.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could remember everything that I despise about that fact that we moved from a city to a province; however, I was amazed to realiz that I have loved that place now more than ever. Actually, I would rather stay there han be back here. Because in cities, there are traffic, pollution, expensive bills,expensive fare; everything is expensive and hassle. 
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But over the years, until we left that place, many things on both infastructure and way of life have changed. I miss the clean environment, the trees, the breeze, the people, the cheap fare, the cheap food; I miss everything about that place.
