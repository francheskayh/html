<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the place where I spent most of my time in school. The longest and treasurable memories were made in the four corners of this campus. This is were I graduated in elementary in the most weird way to other people, amybe, since elementary graduation in Bethel is in 7<sup>th</sup> Grade and we don't wear togas rather sunday dresses and barong for boys.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And during 7<sup>th</sup> Grade, we have this outdoor education, where we go our of the confinements of the school in five days to have some fun and learning.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On those five days being out of school, we went to different places about Leyte. There was a sheep farm, a pineapple farm, a swim to a lake and an island, a tour to a geothermal plant and to a zoo. It was jampacked but it was very enjoyable.<br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I made true friends. The people who I could consider as family and that they would never turn their back on me. The friends, even though we've been afar, still remembers you and asks you about anything under the sun. They still call just to bug you around, though it may sometime annoys me yet I appreciate the bond we have. The connect that will always be there even though we haven't met as a whole for a very long time.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others have moved back to their own country but still we are family. And sooner or later, our dream of visiting each and reuniting anywhere around the globe would come true.<br><br>
